# MCRSCM

Origin of life spatio-temporal simulation of a 2D-3D transition from MCRS (surface metabolism) to SCM (cellularized metabolism). 
Simulation made in C++, plotting in R.
I am using ViennaRNA to map RNA sequences to secondary structures, to calculate dynamic properties. Replicators are tested in different ecological settings like associated to surfaces or in vesicules.
I will provide a complete README as soon as it will be published.
